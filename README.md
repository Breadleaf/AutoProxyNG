# Auto Proxy NG

AutoProxyNG is a client and server protocol that automates Nginx reverse proxy
configurations. Having a server running Nginx as a reverse proxy, this software
enables clients to send requests to that server and create, update, or delete
their specific entry in the Nginx config.

More information to come soon.
